      <p>We are glad to see you here on the official SOBIE website! SOBIE is an annual academic conference that is held at the Sandestin Golf & Resort in San Destin, Florida. This year, the conference was from April 9th to April 11th, but don't worry, there will be another one next year. We don't want to bombard you with information immediately, but if you would like to learn more about what SOBIE is and possibly even attend the conference in the future, feel free to browse through the website and make yourself at home!</p>

                The <b>SOBIE</b> mission is to encourage business faculty members to respond to current economic and market
                issues, and find practical solutions to the many problems business people and public policymakers confront.

              <li class="list-group-item">
                <b>SOBIE</b> invites business and economic research, as well as interdisciplinary research. Research is
                essential to the continuity and pursuit of knowledge. The seeds for economic growth, market innovation, more
                effective business practices, consumer trends, and greater profits often come from the ideas we germinate
                through our
                research.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <b>SOBIE</b> was founded on the idea that peer-reviewed research at small colleges and regional universities was
                viable and needed to be recognized. Faculty, non-academic professionals, business people, doctoral candidates,
                graduate students, and undergraduate students are invited to participate.
